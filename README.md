# A server side of a Premier League score guessing app 
This is a yet unfinished project. The server side will run on render.com. The database holds the users information (such as their username, password(hashed), and their scores) and the bet information (everyone gets to guess each game in a Premier League). The app that will be on a device is at https://github.com/adammarszalek22/pl

# Running the app
The current version of this API can be run with 'flask run' or by using Docker. The modules from requirements.txt need to be installed if running on device using flask - 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
