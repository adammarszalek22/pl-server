1. Create matches database table
2. Get all matches from api
3. Matches that have been finished will be added to database
4. At specific times, a function will be called that will compare the scores in the database to the scores made by users. Once that's done for a particular match then the match in the database will be marked as done! so that we dont have to calculate it again next time.
